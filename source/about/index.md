Hey, hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Luca Santini. Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been passionate about computers, and that enthusiasm has only grown over the years. My journey started with video games, I spent hours playing and eventually tinkering with cheats and mods. Self-taught at first, I then got serious about computer science at university, diving into the theoretical foundations. Fast forward to today, and technology has become my career. I'm now a Penetration Tester and Red Teamer at Spike Reply.

I was born and raised in Senigallia, a seaside town in Italy, in the Marche region. Growing up, math and science were my passions, so after high school, I moved to Milan to study Computer Science and Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano. After earning both my bachelor's and master's degrees, I entered the world of cybersecurity, joining a consulting company where I got hands-on experience as a penetration tester for a variety of clients. Along the way, I also earned several certifications, including OSCP, eCPTx, and OSEP, all of which helped guide me through the vast field of cybersecurity.

In my career, Iâ€™ve explored many areas of cybersecurity: from testing web and mobile applications to trying to pwn entire infrastructures, Wi-Fi networks, and IoT devices. Along the way, I discovered my love for red teaming, a field that combines various skills, knowledge, creativity, and, letâ€™s be honest, a bit of madness. Itâ€™s this mix of everything that keeps me excited about the work I do.
