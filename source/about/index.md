Hey, hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Luca, I am a passionate computer enthusiast since I was a kid. I first started getting into computers through video games, with which I spent a lot of time during my youth. My first experiments began with cheats and mods for video games, as a self-taught learner. They were then refined in university when I started taking things seriously and studying computer science from the theoretical foundations. Fast forward to today, computer science and technology have become my career. I work as Penetration Tester and Red Teamer at Spike Reply.

I was born and raised in Senigallia, a city by the sea in Italy, in the Marche region. I have always been passionate about math and science, and after completing my scientific high school diploma, I moved to Milan to study Computer Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano. After earning both my bachelor's and master's degrees, I officially entered the world of cybersecurity by joining a consulting company. There, I gained my first experiences as a consultant and worked for many different companies as a penetration tester. I have always studied on my own to improve my knowledge, and I have earned several certifications that guided me through the vast field of cybersecurity. Some of the certifications I am most proud of are OSCP, eCPTx, and OSEP.

As a penetration tester, I have scratched the surface of various topics. I have performed penetration testing activities on web applications, mobile applications, individual machines, entire infrastructures, Wi-Fi networks, and various IoT devices. It is here that I began to take an interest in adversarial emulation and red teaming.  For me, red teaming is a mix of various skills and knowledge, combined with a bit of creativity and madness. It contains a little bit of everything, and that's why I love it.
